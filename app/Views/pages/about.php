            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>CityScope was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate journalists and technology enthusiasts who wanted to create a platform where people could access a wide range of reliable news from different fields. The company's founders saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between traditional media and the ever-evolving digital world, and thus, CityScope was born. Since then, we've grown from a small team of 5 to a global team of over 100 journalists, editors, and content creators. Over the years, we've expanded our coverage to include everything from breaking news to detailed analysis of emerging technologies, political developments, and more.</p>
